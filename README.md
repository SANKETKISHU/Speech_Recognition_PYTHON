# Speech Recognition
This code uses the SpeechRecognition library to recognize speech using the microphone as the audio source. It first sets the threshold for ambient noise and then asks the user to say something. The speech is then recognized using Google Speech Recognition and printed to the console.
## Requirements
Python 3.x
SpeechRecognition library
PyAudio library
## Installation
Install Python 3.x from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Install SpeechRecognition and PyAudio libraries using pip:
### pip install SpeechRecognition
### pip install PyAudio
## Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the repository directory and open the command prompt.
Run the following command to start the program:

### python speech.py
When the program prompts you to say something, speak into the microphone.
The program will then print the recognized speech to the console.
## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues with the program, make sure that the microphone is properly connected to your computer and that the PyAudio library is installed correctly.

If you are using a virtual environment, make sure that you have activated it before running the program.
